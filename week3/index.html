 The readings both predicted subsequent events. In 1945, Bush describes a future where machines are prevalent in everyday life. Bush theorized that machines would perform tasks at high speeds that assist people in their daily lives. Today, computers and smartphones do the tasks that Bush envisioned. Especially, the functionality of sharing data and pages that is now done through the web. Bush thought that having quick access to files could save scholars time when researching. While current files can be accessed quickly, there is also so much to read and watch in 2021. Bush also argues that having a technological file system will prevent ideas from getting lost or forgotten; however, algorithms that prioritize and promote some information over others may detract from this functionality.

In the 2010 article from Bernerâ€™s Lee, the web has been created, but much has changed since 2010. Like Berner Lee warns, large companies have started to control big portions of the web, and phone apps create individual spheres of information for each company. Berner Lee highlights that equal access to information is not always possible on the web due to companies promoting or suppressing content from competitors. 

Bush and Berner Lee are both using the technology available to them to predict the next steps in technology. They are both looking to the future to solve technology problems and improve upon current technology.
